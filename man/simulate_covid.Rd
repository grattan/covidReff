\title{Simulate COVID}
\arguments{
\item{R}{The average number of additional people an infected person will infect in an unvaccinated society. It incorporates both the R0 of the variant and behaviours and policies may reduce alter transmission. A single numeric with default 4.5 to represent the Delta variant in a low-restriction society. See \href{https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/993232/S1272_LSHTM_Modelling_Paper_B.1.617.2.pdf}{Kucharski et al (2021)}.}

\item{R_dist}{The distribution of the R value, each with mean equal to R. One of: "constant" (the default); "rpois" (\code{rpois(n, R)}) ; "lnorm" (\code{rlnorm(n, .05, .3)}); or "beta" (\code{rbeta(n, 0.25, 3)}).}

\item{serial_interval}{The average number of days between a person becoming infected and infecting others. A single numeric with default of 5, appropriate for wild type/Delta variant: \href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.04.21258205v1.full.pdf}{Pung et al (2021)}).
A shorter \code{serial_interval} will speed up the virus spread over time.}

\item{vaccination_levels}{Starting vaccination levels. Either a single numeric for a uniformly distributed population wide vaccination rate, or a named vector of length 10 representing the vaccination levels for age groups 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, ..., 91-100. Default is \code{vaccination_levels = c(0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9)}}

\item{vaccination_growth_steepness}{Defines how quickly additional people are vaccinated after opening, defaulting to 0.01. This is the growth parameter (\code{c}) in the logistic curve \code{M / (1 + ((M - n0) / n0) * exp(-c*t))}, where \code{n0} is the starting vaccination level defined by  \code{vaccination_levels}.}

\item{p_max_vaccinated}{Maximum proportion of the population able to be vaccinated. A single numeric with default 0.90. This is the maximium level parameter (\code{M}) in the logistic curve \code{M / (1 + ((M - n0) / n0) * exp(-c*t))}, where \code{n0} is the starting vaccination level defined by  \code{vaccination_levels}.}

\item{only_pfizer_after_opening}{When the simulation starts, do newly vaccinated people only get \code{TRUE} the Pfizer vaccine (the defult), or a mix of}

\item{over60_az_share}{The proportion of vaccinated people over 60 years old who have the AstraZeneca vaccine. Single numeric defaulting to 0.80. Used for vaccine distribution before the simulation starts and, when \code{only_pfizer_after_opening = FALSE}, for new vaccines during the simulation.}

\item{under60_az_share}{The proportion of vaccinated people 60-years-old and younger who have the AstraZeneca vaccine. Single numeric defaulting to 0.10. Used for vaccine distribution before the simulation starts and, when \code{only_pfizer_after_opening = FALSE}, for new vaccines during the simulation.}

\item{kids_R_reduction}{The proportion reduction in transmission of children under the age of 18 defaulting to 0.3.}

\item{vac_transmission_reduction}{The reduction in the likelihood of transmission from an infected vaccinated person relative to an infected unvaccinated person. A single numeric with default 0.5, representing a 50 per cent reduction in transmission from vaccinated infection people.}

\item{death_rate}{The likelihood that an infected unvaccinated person dies by age. Either a character "loglinear", the default, which uses the log-linear relationship between age and mortality of \code{10^(-3.27 + 0.0524 * age) / 100} described in \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7721859/}{Levin et al (2021)} and capped at 0.28. Alternatively, the user can provide a numeric vector of length 10 describing the death rates for age groups 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, ..., 91-100.}

\item{treatment_death_reduction}{The reduction in mortality from treatments. A single numeric with default 0.2 that proportionally reduces \code{death_rate} values. E.g. with \code{treatment_death_reduction = 0.2}, a person with a 10 per cent pre-treatment risk of dying from Covid would have an 8 per cent risk with treatment.}

\item{n_population}{Population size for each simulation. A single numeric defaulting to 2.6e6 (about 10 per cent of the Australian population).}

\item{n_start_infected}{An integer for the number of people infected at the beginning of the simulation. A numeric defaulting to 100 people infected at day 0.}

\item{n_daily_introductions}{An integer for the number of new external infections introduced each day. A numeric defaulting to 1.}

\item{n_iterations}{Number of iterations the simulation runs for. A single integer defaulting to 3L. Means that the simulation runs for \code{serial_interval * n_iterations} days.}

\item{run_simulations}{The number of times the simulation is run. A single integer defaulting to  1L.}

\item{scenario}{Name of the scenario. Defaults to "1". This is useful when using \code{purrr::map} or \code{lapply} over a number of scenarios.}
